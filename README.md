A repo of the full version of my game _Barking Irons_, a project I was developing from August 2021 to November 2021.

You can find a playable version of the jam version [here](https://ivess.itch.io/barking-irons).

# History

Initially developed for _AI and Games Jam 2021_ in a week in August 2021, which scored #21 out of 127 entries ([full game ratings](https://itch.io/jam/aiandgames-2021/rate/1068797)).

After an initial wave of positive feedback, the development of the game was continued. The development process was covered in the [Barking Irons devlog series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYjZbdzwGEQkp-IgPgBZ3Ssrqv9gn3zJJ) I made on my YouTube channel.

The development of _Barking Irons_ has been canceled in November 2021.
